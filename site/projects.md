# Projects

## Pink
Pink is a game engine I'm currently working on. Its still very early so no source or screenshots are available. My main goal is to have something that works on low end hardware and is easy to use. I'm writing it in c# however I'm debating switching to C.

## Rosie
[Github Page](https://github.com/saavor/rosie)

Rosie is a game framework for Roblox I made in august-september 2022 as a summer project.
Its not great but it works. I plan on going back and restructuring it.
